SYNOPSIS 

This project is to create a fun environment where people can chat with random unknown people without sharing their details. The idealogy of this project was based on the pen pal culture. Which is a very popular culture in the period of 90's. Where people write letters to random unknown people for creating connections and joy. 

Chattrom is an enhanced digital version of pen palling. Here people can quickly start their chat and get connected. Nowdays, we prefer things to be done quickly writing letters and posting is a time taking one which will not fit in our today's busy schedule. Which becomes a barrier and culture loss.

To breakdown those barriers we need a solution which is apt for this current technology- driven world. In this room we can chat with real-time people and share stuffs like something memorable with highly priortizing the privacy of the users you don't even need to share your name and also comes with cool features which engages the users.
